to run these projects 
       1 . We need to open terminal at that folder
       2 . Activate virtual environment  (command : virtual_environment_name\Scripts\Activate)
       3 . Now we need to run our server (command : python manage.py runserver )
       4 . Now in terminal we will get a link then copy that link and paste in your browser 
       5 . Then we will enter into our web page 
       6 . After Performing all your activities we need to DEactivate our environment
